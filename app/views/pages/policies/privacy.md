**Last updated: October 14, 2025**

In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We never sell your data.

This policy applies to the Blendergrid render service built and maintained by Blendergrid LLC.

This policy applies to our handling of information about site visitors, prospective customers, and customers. We refer collectively to these categories of individuals as "you" throughout this policy.

## What we collect and why

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here's what that means in practice:

### Identity and access

When you sign up for Blendergrid, we ask for your name and email address. That's so you can personalize your account, and we can send you essential service notifications, render completion alerts, and payment receipts. We require email verification to prevent abuse and ensure we can contact you about your renders.

You may optionally provide a company name, billing address, and phone number. This information helps with invoicing and support.

We may send you optional marketing emails and newsletters on an opt-out basis. You can unsubscribe from these at any time. We will continue to send transactional emails related to your renders and account.

We'll never sell your personal information to third parties, and we won't use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission.

### Billing information

Payment processing is handled by Stripe. When you make a payment, your credit card information is submitted directly to Stripe and never touches Blendergrid servers. We receive from Stripe only a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number, for purposes of account history and billing support.

For alternative payment methods (PayPal, direct bank transfer, cryptocurrency), we work with you directly but do not store sensitive payment credentials.

We may use aggregate billing information to guide our marketing efforts.

### Render jobs and file data

We store the project files you upload to Blendergrid so we can render them as requested. We run an automatic benchmark on each project to calculate server-hours and pricing. We do not analyze or scan your files beyond this benchmark process.

We log metadata about your uploads including file names, file sizes, upload times, and render settings (resolution, quality settings) necessary for pricing and service delivery.

We keep your project files and rendered output for the retention periods specified in the "Data retention" section below.

### Technical and security data

**IP addresses**: We log your IP address when you sign up and each time you access your account. We retain IP addresses in logs for 90 days and keep them associated with your account indefinitely while your account is active. We use this data for security, fraud prevention, and to detect multiple account abuse.

**Browser and system information**: We collect information about your browser type, operating system version, and which pages you visit on our site. This helps us optimize the service and troubleshoot issues. We do not use cookies for analytics.

**Fraud prevention**: We monitor for suspicious patterns such as multiple account signups from the same IP address or payment source. This is handled internally without third-party fraud detection services.

### Cookies

Blendergrid uses cookies only for essential functionality:

- **Session cookies**: Required for you to stay logged in to your account
- **Affiliate tracking**: We track affiliate referrals server-side without cookies

We do not use cookies for analytics, advertising, or tracking across sites. Because we only use essential cookies, you won't see a cookie consent banner.

### Advertising

We run ads on Google Ads. We do not use tracking pixels, cookies, or scripts from ad networks on the Blendergrid website. Any advertising measurement is done through aggregated, non-personalized reporting from the ad platform.

### Voluntary correspondence

When you email Blendergrid with questions or support requests, we keep that correspondence and your email address so we have history to reference if you contact us again. This correspondence is stored in HelpScout, our support ticket system.

We also store information you may volunteer, such as responses to surveys.

## When we access or disclose your information

### To provide services you've requested

We use third-party service providers to help run Blendergrid:

- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: Hosts our infrastructure and stores your project files and rendered output. Servers are located in various AWS regions worldwide.
- **Stripe**: Processes payments and stores payment information on our behalf.
- **HelpScout**: Manages support tickets and correspondence with customers.

### To help you with support

No Blendergrid staff member looks at your project files or rendered content except with your express permission when you request support. If we need to access your files to troubleshoot an issue, we will ask for your consent first.

We may access system logs and metadata as part of ensuring service security and performance without accessing your actual project content.

### To investigate or prevent abuse

If we have reason to believe your account is being used for prohibited purposes as defined in our Terms of Service, we may access your account information and take appropriate action, including notifying authorities if required by law.

### Aggregated and de-identified data

We may aggregate and de-identify information collected through the service. We may use de-identified or aggregated data for any purpose, including improving our service and marketing.

### When required under applicable law

Blendergrid LLC is a U.S. company with data infrastructure located in the United States and other countries via AWS.

**Requests for user data**: Our policy is to not respond to government requests for user data unless compelled by legal process or in limited emergency circumstances. If U.S. law enforcement has a necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring us to disclose data, we must comply. We will only respond to requests from non-U.S. government authorities if compelled by the U.S. government through procedures outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement.

It is Blendergrid's policy to notify affected users before we disclose data unless legally prohibited from doing so, and except in emergency cases.

**Preservation requests**: We comply with requests to preserve data only if compelled by the U.S. Federal Stored Communications Act or by a properly served U.S. subpoena for civil matters. We do not disclose preserved data unless required by law or compelled by a court order. Unless we receive a proper warrant, court order, or subpoena before the preservation period expires, we will destroy any preserved copies at the end of the preservation period.

**Tax audits**: If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to disclose billing-related information. If that happens, we will disclose only the minimum needed.

**Business transfers**: If Blendergrid is acquired by or merges with another company, we'll notify you well before any of your personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Your rights with respect to your information

We strive to apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of location. Some of these rights include:

**Right to Know**: You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared, or sold. We outline the categories and specific data we collect in this privacy policy.

**Right of Access**: You have the right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security, and processing of that information.

**Right to Correction**: You have the right to request correction of your personal information.

**Right to Erasure / "To Be Forgotten"**: You have the right to request that your personal information be erased from our systems. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using Blendergrid because the service may no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.

**Right to Complain**: You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.

**Right to Restrict Processing**: You have the right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of your personal information. (We never have and never will sell your personal data.)

**Right to Object**: You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.

**Right to Portability**: You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party. You can export your project files and rendered output directly from your account.

**Right to not Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making**: You have the right to object to and prevent any decision that could have a legal or similarly significant effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.

**Right to Non-Discrimination**: We do not and will not charge you a different amount, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, exercising certain rights may prevent you from using our service.

Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and updating your account information. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need to retain certain information to provide our service to you.

In some cases, we need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request. If we are unable to verify you, we may be unable to respond to your requests.

If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at support@blendergrid.com. If an authorized agent is corresponding on your behalf, we will need written consent with a signature from the account holder before proceeding.

Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to appeal our decision to deny your request. We will provide information about how to exercise that right in our response denying the request. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. If you are in the EU or UK, you can contact your data protection authority to file a complaint or learn more about local privacy laws.

## How we secure your data

All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our servers to your browser. Database backups are also encrypted. We go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.

Our infrastructure is hosted on AWS, which provides multiple layers of security including network isolation, DDoS protection, and encrypted storage.

Access to customer data is restricted to authorized personnel only and requires multi-factor authentication.

## What happens when you delete content in your account

When you delete project files or rendered output from your account, the content is immediately removed from active storage. Deleted content may remain in our backup systems for up to 60 days before being permanently purged.

If you cancel your account, all your content becomes immediately inaccessible and will be permanently deleted from active systems within 30 days and from backups within 60 days. We cannot recover this information once it has been permanently deleted.

## Data retention

We keep your information for the time necessary for the purposes for which it is processed:

- **Account information** (name, email): Retained while your account is active and for 90 days after account deletion
- **Project files**: Stored for 30 days after upload, with backups retained for up to 60 days total
- **Rendered output**: Available for download for 14 days, with backups retained for up to 60 days on request
- **Payment records**: Retained for 7 years for tax and accounting purposes
- **IP address logs**: Retained for 90 days in active logs; associated with your account indefinitely while account is active
- **Support correspondence**: Retained while your account is active and for 90 days after account deletion

## Location of site and data

Blendergrid uses AWS infrastructure located in multiple regions worldwide. We select regions based on performance and cost optimization, which means your data may be stored in different geographic locations at different times.

If you are located in the European Union, UK, or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us may be transferred to and stored in the United States or other countries. By using our service and providing us with your personal information, you consent to this transfer.

## When transferring personal data from the EU

The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has issued guidance that personal data transferred out of the EU must be treated with the same level of protection that is granted under EU privacy law. UK law provides similar safeguards for UK user data that is transferred out of the UK.

Blendergrid relies on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission for transfers of personal data outside the EEA. We also implement supplementary measures to ensure adequate protection of personal data, including encryption in transit and at rest, access controls, and contractual protections with our service providers.

If you are in the EU or UK and have concerns about how your data is transferred or processed, please contact us at support@blendergrid.com.

## California Residents

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have specific rights regarding their personal information. The rights listed in the "Your rights with respect to your information" section above apply to California residents. We do not sell personal information as defined by the CCPA. If you are a California resident and would like to exercise your rights, please contact us at support@blendergrid.com.

## Changes and questions

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. If we make significant changes, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and notify active users via email.

Have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, your data, or your rights with respect to your information? Please get in touch by emailing us at support@blendergrid.com.
