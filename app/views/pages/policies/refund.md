# Refund Policy

**Last updated: October 14, 2025**

If you're ever unhappy with Blendergrid for any reason, contact our support team at support@blendergrid.com. We'll work with you to find a fair solution.

## How Payment and Refunds Work

Blendergrid offers two payment methods:

1. **Direct payment**: Pay for each render job directly via Stripe. Payment authorizes the render to start.
2. **Render credits**: Pre-purchase credits to your account and use them for future renders.

**Direct payment refunds**: If you paid directly for a render via Stripe, refunds are processed back to your original payment method within 30 days of payment. After 30 days, Stripe's refund window closes and we can only issue account credits.

**Render credit refunds**: You can request a cash refund for unused purchased credits within 30 days of purchase. After 30 days, unused credits remain in your account indefinitely but cannot be refunded to cash.

**Promotional or gifted credits**: Credits received through promotions, affiliate partnerships, or gifts cannot be refunded for cash.

## Automatic Cancellation Refunds

If you cancel a render job while it's in progress, you'll automatically receive a partial credit refund based on completion percentage:

- Cancel at 0% complete = 100% refund
- Cancel at 10% complete = 90% refund
- Cancel at 50% complete = 50% refund
- And so on

**For direct payments**: If you paid directly via Stripe for the render, the refund is issued as account credits. This allows you to quickly fix your project and re-render immediately without waiting for payment processing. If you don't use the refunded credits within 24 hours, they'll automatically convert to a Stripe refund. You can also manually request an immediate Stripe refund instead of waiting.

**For pre-purchased credits**: Refunded credits return to your account balance for future use.

## Examples of Refunds We'd Grant

Here are situations where we'd issue refunds or credits:

**Render submission mistakes:**

- You accidentally submitted a render with wrong settings and canceled immediately (at 0% progress). Full automatic refund.
- You changed your mind right after submitting. Cancel at 0% and get a full refund.

**Quality or technical issues:**

- Your render failed due to our infrastructure problems. Full refund.
- Your render completed but has quality issues and we can't figure out how to fix it together. Full refund.
- We missed your deadline due to problems on our end. Full refund, even if the render eventually completed.

**General dissatisfaction:**

- You tried Blendergrid for the first few renders and it's just not working for your workflow. We'll refund those early jobs if you're not happy.
- Your render completed on time and looks fine technically, but the result isn't what you wanted and we've exhausted troubleshooting options together. We'll issue a refund.

**Account issues:**

- You were charged for credits but meant to use a different payment method. We'll refund and help you re-purchase correctly.
- Your account was compromised and unauthorized renders were submitted. If we can verify the security breach, we'll restore your credit balance.

## Large Production Jobs ($10,000+)

For jobs over $10,000, we assume you've tested your project with smaller test renders first and have confirmed everything works correctly. These are some of the largest render jobs we handle, and the cloud compute costs are substantial.

**We'll still provide full refunds if:**

- The failure was entirely due to our infrastructure or service
- We missed your deadline due to problems on our end
- Technical errors on our side caused render quality issues

**We cannot guarantee full refunds if:**

- The issue stemmed from your project setup or settings
- You didn't run test renders before the full production job
- The render completed successfully but you changed your mind about the project

We strongly encourage reaching out to us before submitting large production jobs so we can review your project and help ensure success.

## Service Credits for Issues on Our End

We'll consider issuing service credits if:

- We had extended downtime that didn't affect your deadline but disrupted your workflow. (If downtime caused you to miss a deadline, that's a full refund situation.)
- Our service had performance issues that made the platform frustrating to use, even if renders completed.

We operate on best-effort support and typically respond within a few hours. We don't offer guaranteed support response times or credits for delayed responses.

## Disputed Charges

If you dispute a charge with your bank, we'll provide evidence of the service delivered. If you still wish to dispute after reviewing the evidence, we'll process a refund rather than fight it.

## Get in Touch

At the end of the day, nearly everything on the edges comes down to the situation. If you have a question about your refund eligibility or want to request a refund, please contact support@blendergrid.com. We'll work with you to find a reasonable solution.
