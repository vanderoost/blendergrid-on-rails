# Terms of Service

**Last updated: October 14, 2025**

When you use the Blendergrid render service, you are agreeing to these latest Terms of Service ("Terms"). Violation of these terms may, at our discretion, result in us terminating your account.

We may update these Terms of Service at any time. If we make significant changes, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and notify users who have signed up to our service.

## Definitions

"Company", "we", "our", or "us" in any of our policies or terms, refers to Blendergrid LLC.

"Services" refers to our website blendergrid.com, and any service created and maintained by Blendergrid LLC.

Finally, "you" or "your" refers to the people or organizations that own an account with our Services.

## Account Terms

1.  You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password and for ensuring that any of your users do the same. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
2.  You are responsible for all content submitted to and activity that occurs under your account.
3.  You must be a human. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.
4.  You must be at least 18 years of age to use this service. If you are under 18, you may use the service only with the involvement and consent of a parent or legal guardian.

## Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes

1.  **Pricing Calculation**: Render jobs are priced based on an automatic benchmark run on your project that calculates required server-hours combined with your requested deadline.
2.  **Pre-Payment Requirement**: Payment is required before a render job begins. Your payment authorization serves as the start signal for rendering.
3.  **Render Credits**: Payments create render credits in your account. Credits do not expire and can be used for future render jobs.
4.  **Payment Failure**: If payment fails or is not completed, your render job will not start.
5.  **Taxes**: All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities. Otherwise, you are responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, or duties.
6.  **Refunds**: We process refunds according to our [Refund Policy](/policies/refund/). If you request a refund for any reason, we will process it.

## Render Jobs and Service Terms

1.  **Job Scheduling**: Render jobs are scheduled based on the deadline you request when submitting the project. We do not offer separate priority tiers.
2.  **Completion Guarantees**: We render projects within your requested deadline on a best-effort basis. This approach is successful 99% of the time. We do not provide service-level agreements or guaranteed completion times.
3.  **Delayed Renders**: If we determine that your render will be delayed beyond your requested deadline, we will communicate this to you in advance and offer a refund if the delay causes problems for your project.
4.  **Job Cancellation**: You may cancel a queued or in-progress render job at any time. A partial credit refund will be automatically applied based on render progress. For example, canceling at 10% completion results in a 90% refund. If refunded credits are not used within 24 hours, they will be automatically converted to a Stripe refund if the original payment was made through Stripe.
5.  **Benchmark Process**: Each submitted project undergoes an automatic benchmark to calculate required server-hours and determine pricing. Maximum render time per job varies based on this benchmark.
6.  **Render Failures**: If a render fails due to our infrastructure or service errors, you may request a refund, which we will process.

## Storage and File Management

1.  **Upload Limits**: The maximum file size per project upload is 100GB.
2.  **Source File Storage**: We store your uploaded source files for 30 days after upload. Files remain in our backup systems for up to 60 days total.
3.  **Rendered Output Storage**: Completed renders are available for download for 14 days. On request, we can retrieve renders from backup systems for up to 60 days total.
4.  **Storage Quotas**: There is no storage quota per user. Pricing is based solely on required compute power for rendering.

## Acceptable Use Policy

1.  **Prohibited Content**: You may not use our Services to create, store, or distribute content that is illegal under United States federal or state law. This includes but is not limited to: child sexual abuse material, content that facilitates terrorism, content that violates export control laws, or content used to conduct illegal activity.
2.  **Infrastructure Protection**: You may not use our Services in any way that harms, disables, overburdens, or impairs our infrastructure or interferes with any other party's use of the Services.
3.  **No Monitoring**: We do not proactively monitor uploaded content or rendered output. We rely on legal process, user reports, and other notifications to become aware of prohibited content.
4.  **Enforcement**: If we become aware that your account is being used for prohibited purposes, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and remove the content.

## Cancellation and Termination

1.  You are solely responsible for properly deleting your account. If you need help deleting your account, you can always [contact our Support team](mailto:support@blendergrid.com).
2.  All of your content will be inaccessible from the Services immediately upon account deletion. Within 30 days, all content will be permanently deleted from active systems and logs. Within 90 days, all content will be permanently deleted from our backups. We cannot recover this information once it has been permanently deleted.
3.  We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any time. Suspension means you will not be able to access the account or any content in the account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the deletion of all content in your account. We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time.
4.  Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of a Company employee or officer will result in immediate account termination.

## Modifications to the Service and Prices

1.  We intend to support our Services as far as it is possible and reasonable to do so. That means when it comes to security, privacy, and customer support, we will continue to maintain any legacy Services. Sometimes it becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or we redesign a part of our Services because we think it could be better or we decide to close new signups of a product. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Services with or without notice.
2.  Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about changes on our websites or the affected Services themselves.

## Uptime, Security, and Privacy

1.  Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We target 99% uptime but do not offer service-level agreements. If downtime causes render delays beyond your requested deadline, we will offer refunds as described in the Render Jobs section.
2.  We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the Services. We'll reach out to the account owner before taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers.
3.  We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data transmission from the public Internet.
4.  You agree that Blendergrid may process your data as described in our [Privacy Policy](/policies/privacy) and for no other purpose. On rare occasion, our staff may access your data for the following reasons:
    *   **To help you with support requests you make.** We'll ask for express consent before accessing your account.
    *   **On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an automated process partway through.** We get automated alerts when such errors occur. When we can fix the issue and restart automated processing without looking at any personal data, we do. In rare cases, we have to look at a minimum amount of personal data to fix the issue.
    *   **To safeguard Blendergrid.** We'll look at logs and metadata as part of our work to ensure the security of your data and the Services as a whole. If necessary, we may also access accounts as part of an abuse report investigation.
    *   **To the extent required by applicable law.** As a U.S. company, we only preserve or share customer data if compelled by a U.S. government authority with a legally binding order or proper request under the Stored Communications Act, or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. If a non-U.S. authority approaches Blendergrid for assistance, our default stance is to refuse unless the order has been approved by the U.S. government, which compels us to comply through procedures outlined in an established mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement mechanism. If Blendergrid is audited by a tax authority, we only share the bare minimum billing information needed to complete the audit.
5.  We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services.

## Copyright and Content Ownership

1.  You give us a limited license to use the content posted by you and your users in order to provide the Services to you, but we claim no ownership rights over those materials. All materials you submit to the Services remain yours.
2.  We do not pre-screen content, but we reserve the right (but not the obligation) in our sole discretion to refuse or remove any content that is available via the Service.
3.  The Company or its licensors own all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, including all intellectual property rights therein, and you obtain no ownership rights in the Services as a result of your use. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements without express written permission from the Company. You must request permission to use the Company's logos or any Service logos for promotional purposes. Please [email us](mailto:support@blendergrid.com) requests to use logos. We reserve the right to rescind any permissions if you violate these Terms.
4.  You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Services, use of the Services, or access to the Services without the express written permission of the Company.

## API Terms

We offer an Application Program Interface ("API") for our Services. Any use of the API, including through a third-party product that accesses the Services, is bound by these Terms plus the following specific terms:

1.  You expressly understand and agree that we are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.
2.  Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Services via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. If we need to suspend your account's access, we will attempt to warn the account owner first. If your API usage could or has caused downtime, we may cut off access without prior notice.

## Dispute Resolution and Governing Law

1.  **Governing Law**: These Terms and any dispute arising out of or related to them or the Services will be governed by the laws of the State of Wyoming and applicable United States federal law, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
2.  **Arbitration Agreement**: Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court. The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
3.  **Exceptions to Arbitration**: Either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's intellectual property rights.
4.  **No Class Actions**: You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Blendergrid LLC, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable legal fees, arising out of or in any way connected with: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your content or projects; (c) your violation of these Terms; or (d) your violation of any rights of another party.

## Liability

You expressly understand and agree that Blendergrid LLC shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses resulting from: (a) the use or inability to use the Services; (b) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (c) statements or conduct of any third party on the Services; or (d) any other matter relating to the Services.

In jurisdictions that do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, our liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
